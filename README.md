# Ink Workspace

Welcome to the official issue-only repo for Ink Workspace. This is a desktop app that replaces built-in Windows Ink Workspace in Windows 10 and Windows 11. The app  uses WPF and UWP (as XAML Islands) and allows you to run installed apps, quick actions, capture screen or windows, manage recent files and more.
